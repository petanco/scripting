# Bash scripting

Bash based script that, inputting some information and a .CSV curated file, is able to:

  1- Read a .CSV curated file, which column separator is a semicolon ';'  
  
  2- Get the last added uidNumber to your LDAP Server and insert the new users one number above  
  
  3- Generate a .LDIF file with all the passed users from the .CSV  
  
  4- Show the user the first entry in that .LDIF file, the last entry and the total number of entries  
  
  5- Ask for confirmation  
  
  6- Run the .LDIF file and add the users to the LDAP Server  
  
  7- Show the user the last two user details so he/she can assure that the command has been run correctly  
  
  
Enjoy :)
